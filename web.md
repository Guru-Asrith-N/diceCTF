### Funny Login

opened challenge  
downloaded the attchment in linux terminal   
used `tar xvzf funnylogin.tar.gz` to unzip file  
opened the unzipped file and checked its contents  
opened and went inside the public folder  
realised that the file stored in it is nothing but the source code of the website   
exited the folder   
opened each of the files stored in funnylogin folder  
realised that app.js contains how the website works  
opened the website  
tried to check source code if it can provide any help  
thought that sql injection might work  
read through sql injection in google  
tried entering `' or '1'='1`  
initially entered in only in password  
then entered in both password and userID  
then tried `admin or 1=1`. Didn't work   
went through the writeup for funny login
